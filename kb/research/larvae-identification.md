Developed a CNN-based larvae identification pipeline in PyTorch using fine-tuned ResNet-34 models, achieving an F1-score of 0.92.

Added LLM-generated explanations for misclassification analysis to improve interpretability.

Optimized preprocessing with OpenCV and Kubernetes to reduce inference latency from 200 ms to 140 ms.
