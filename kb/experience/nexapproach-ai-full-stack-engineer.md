Engineered a high-performance Next.js platform with LangChain, supporting 500+ simultaneous users through real-time WebSockets and tuned SSR for fast, consistent response times.

Architected a resilient AWS setup using Lambda (Node 18.x), API Gateway with custom auth, and DynamoDB, achieving sub-100ms end-to-end latency and around 99.5% service availability.

Delivered secure, scalable REST APIs with JWT-based authentication and 100 req/min rate limiting, while integrating GPT-4 into cost-optimized, fault-tolerant workflows for production use.
