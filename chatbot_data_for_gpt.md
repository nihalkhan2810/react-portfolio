# Mohammed Nihal Khan - Portfolio Data for ChatGPT Integration

## Personal Information

### Hero Content
```
I'm an AI Engineer and Researcher with over 3 years of experience, driven by a fascination for how machines can learn and solve real-world problems. My journey into AI started with a deep curiosity, leading me to build scalable deep learning systems and practical AI solutions. I specialize in areas like computer vision (think things like CNNs and using tools like OpenCV) and machine learning (using powerful frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow). I also enjoy taking things from concept to reality, which is where my experience with cloud deployment on AWS and Kubernetes comes in. Ultimately, I love building end-to-end solutions that are not only technically robust but also efficient and easy for people to use. I'm also comfortable on the full-stack side, having built things using React and Flask.

### About Text
```
I bring a practical approach to AI, combining technical expertise with a focus on solving real-world problems. My academic journey, with degrees from the University of Windsor (Master's in Electrical & Computer Engineering) and Sathyabama Institute (Bachelor's in Information Technology), has provided a strong base. My career is built on a fascination with machine learning and a desire to create intelligent systems that make a difference.
I specialize in computer vision, deep learning, and NLP, with hands-on experience in key tools like PyTorch and TensorFlow. I've also worked with Large Language Models (LLMs), fine-tuning and deploying them using Hugging Face and LangChain for applications like chatbots and document analysis. I'm also comfortable with full-stack development, having built projects like this website using React. I thrive in collaborative environments and am always looking for ways to contribute to innovative solutions while learning and growing.
Outside of work, I'm always keeping up with the latest in AI, contributing to open-source projects, and staying active through sports and fitness. My goal is to keep building cutting-edge technology that solves problems and makes a real impact.
